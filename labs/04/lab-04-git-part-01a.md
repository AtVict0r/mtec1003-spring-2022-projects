# Lab 4 Part 1: Pull Requests + Merge Conflicts
_Refer to the [Tutorial on Pull Requests + Merge Conflicts](/Goldford-MTEC1003-OL04/labs/04/git.pull.requests.and.merge.tutorial.v01.html) and to [Lab 3](https://einbahnstrasse.github.io/Goldford-MTEC1003-OL04/labs/03/lab-03-git-intro.html) for an explanation of the steps below._

For this lab, you'll be:
1. Creating a `remote repository` initialized with a README.md file on _GitHub_, then  
2. Posting its address to Google Sheets;  
3. Visiting the other repositories listed on the same Sheet, and   
4. For each repository, `fork` a copy to your own _GitHub_ account, then  
5. Make a change (anywhere) to its README file,  
6. `Commit` your change, and submit a `pull request` to the author.  
7. Then, look over all `pull request`s from the class, within your own `repository`,  
8. Accept the changes you like and `merge` these into your "source code", and   
9. Finally, resolve any `merge conflict`s.

### Create a Remote Repository on _GitHub_  

* Log into your _GitHub_ account, and from the front page, click the green **New** button and initialize a `repository` with a README.md (i.e. be sure to check the box for a README file).  
* Write something in your own README file. This can be anything, really. Sprinkle some random text on multiple lines to give your file some dimension. Even just something short to identify yourself is fine! This is like your _source code_...
* Now, from the address bar in your web browser, `copy` the address of your new `repository`.
* `Paste` this address into the Google Sheet below, next to your name. You'll need to [sign into Google Sheets with your Entertainment Technology email address](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m-ILOrqra5h8MVR735iDlfs80h6aThcjHsZ6RaSNO3I/edit?usp=sharing) in order to add your link. If this doesn't work, send the instructor an email with your link and it will be added immediately.

The sheet will become populated with new repos for each member of our class, so refresh this page frequently:

### Do this part "for each" repo listed in the Google Sheet:  

* Visit a repository for clicking on the link in the Google Sheet.  
* Click the `fork` button in the upper-right.  
* In your own "forked" copy of the `repository`, click the `pen tool` to directly edit the README.md file.  
* Make changes, enter new text, or scramble the text that's already there. Go crazy! (You can also copy and paste the same text into each of the repositories on the Sheet, to make things go faster...)  
* `Commit` your changes.  
* Submit a `pull request` to the original author.  

* * *

### `Merge` changes in your own repository  

* Go back to your own `repository`  
* Click on `pull request`s. There should be a number of them, once all students have had a chance to submit theirs.  
* Click on the **Merge pull requests** button.  
* Examine any conflicting changes where multiple users have submitted changes on the same line of code.  
* Edit your document by selecting the changes that seem "best."  
* When you're finished, click **Mark as resolved** and finally **Commit merge**.
* For any remaining `pull request`s that you don't approve of, hit **Close and commment**. Feel free to include a message to your classmages about why you're not accepting their changes.  
* Your lab is complete when there are no outstanding `pull request`s. They should all be `merge`d or closed.
