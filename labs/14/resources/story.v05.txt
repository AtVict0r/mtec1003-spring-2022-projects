<p>(CNN) - Small reptiles like lizards and geckos are known for their extraordinary ability to regrow their tails, a potentially lifesaving skill in the wild. But it turns out these reptiles are not the only animals in the amniote family with the ability to regenerate appendages.</p>
<p>Researchers were surprised to discover that juvenile alligators also have the ability to regrow their tails up to 9 inches, or up to 18% of their total body length, according to a new study in Scientific Reports.</p>
<p>A team of scientists from Arizona State University and the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries used advanced imaging techniques together with time-tested methods of studying anatomy and tissue organization to find that the alligators' regrown tails had a central cartilage skeleton without any bone, exhibiting features of both regeneration and wound repair.</p>
<p>"The regrown skeleton was surrounded by connective tissue and skin but lacked any skeletal muscle (which lizard tails do regenerate with)," Kenro Kusumi, co-senior study author and professor and director of ASU's School of Life Sciences and associate dean in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, told CNN.</p>
<p>Even a muscle-less regrown tail is vital for the massive predators, Kusumi added.</p>
<p>The team of researchers says that understanding these limitations may help in developing regenerative therapies in humans.</p>
<p>"We know that humans -- who are incapable of regenerating -- have the same cells and pathways being used to regenerate in these other animals," Jeanne Wilson-Rawls, co-senior study author and associate professor with ASU's School of Life Sciences, told CNN.</p>
<p>"If this very large long-limbed animal has this ability, can we take advantage of this to help people who have lost limbs or burn victims who need skin regeneration?"</p>
<p>Kusumi quickly added that this isn't something that is going to happen tomorrow, but maybe by the end of the century.</p>
