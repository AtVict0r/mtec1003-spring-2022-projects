## 1. Overview of This Lab  

By now, you've learned all about creating a multi-page website, designing it with a good layout, your own preferred colors and typefaces (fonts), and pushing the site to _GitHub Pages_ for remote hosting.  

Previously, you brainstormed ideas for content on your own site, helping you prepare for the final assignment in MTEC1003.  

In short, you have all the ingredients you need to complete your own personal website!  

The remainder of your week will be spent finishing your own site, pushing it to _GitHub Pages_, and preparing to present your work to the class next week: our final class this semester.  

Below, I'll describe the requirements for this lab:

<a id="reqs"></a>
## 1. Requirements of Lab 15 (Your Website)  

Previously you gathered your ideas and planned for your website in [Lab 12 / Part 3: Preparing for Your Final Assignment](/Goldford-MTEC1003-OL04/labs/12/lab-12a-part3-final-prep.html){:target="_blank"}.  

For the final project, you will take this content you developed and plug it into the website template presented to you in [Lab 14: Advanced Web Design + _GitHub Pages_](/Goldford-MTEC1003-OL04/labs/14/lab-14-web-design-github-pages.html){:target="_blank"}.  

Your website will be hosted on _GitHub_ in a repository with name of your choice _(Recommended: lab-15-personal-site)_ and then **CLONE** it onto your local machine inside your **/mtec1003** folder. (As always, use your knowledge of git and all of your previous references in order to do this.)   

You can choose your own repository name to further personalize your site; especially if you want to share it publicly _(e.g. Louis-Goldford-homepage)._  

<span style="color:red">You will finish your site this week, push it to _GitHub Pages_, and to complete Lab 15 you'll EMAIL ME 2 LINKS by the start of class next Monday, December 14:</span>  

> <span style="color:lightseagreen">https://github.com/</span><span style="color:lime">yourUserName</span><span style="color:lightseagreen">/</span><span style="color:OliveDrab">lab-15-personal-site/</span>

and  

> <span style="color:lightseagreen">https://</span><span style="color:lime">yourUserName</span><span style="color:lightseagreen">.github.io/</span><span style="color:OliveDrab">lab-15-personal-site/</span>  

(The 1st link is the "back end" of your site, where I can see the source files you pushed. The 2nd link is the "front end", or the website interface itself.)  

Your website must have a minimum of 4 linked pages:  

1. a Home page   
  - _Must have some kind of artwork, e.g. JavaScript Canvas drawing and/or animation._  
2. an "About Me" page
  - _Must include your biography (or a resume if you wish), and a description of your professional goals._    
3. at least 1 Portfolio page, displaying your own creative work and/or coding examples
  - _Post pictures and/or videos, or if you have neither, display your code from this class or others._  
4. a "Contact" page, where people can easily learn how to reach you (e.g. email and/or phone number)
  - _Don't worry! If you don't want to use your real contact information, just make something up! It can be fake!_  
  - _Recommended: Use your CityTech email as a contact source._  

In addition, your website must have the following elements:  

* Create a **navbar** at the top of your site's pages, for easy page linking across your site.
  - _Use the template provided in_ [_Lab 14: Advanced Web Design + GitHub Pages_](/Goldford-MTEC1003-OL04/labs/14/lab-14-web-design-github-pages.html){:target="_blank"} _to create & stylize your navbar!_   
* Use `<div>` containers to separate, stylize, and position content on your pages.    
* Use **class** and **ID** selectors to distinguish between _group_ styling and _individual_ styling throughout your site.  
* You must choose your own website colors (using any of the tools discussed. e.g. Adobe Color).  
  - _Recommended: You can use the Adobe Color tool to extract a color scheme from a photo you may use on your site!_  
* You must include your own preferred fonts (using Google Fonts).
  - _Recommended: Choose at least 2 fonts (1 for headings and another for body text, also demonstrated in Lab 14.)_  

You may **optionally** include a "hero image" at the top of your website as well.  

<span style="color:red"><i><b>CRUCIAL:</b> Reusing the fonts, color schemes, photos, and other content given in our tutorials is <b>strictly prohibited.</b> You will need to "design" your site yourselves: choose your own colors, fonts, images, and potentially videos and layout. You now have the tools to make your own creative decisions. Repeating the same elements in your own site will result in a lowered grade!</i></span>  

At the end of this lab, your **/lab-15-personal-site** repo should contain the following files:  

1. your Home Page, e.g. **index.html**  
2. an External Style Sheet, e.g. **style.css**  
3. Your "About Me" page, e.g. **aboutme.html**  
4. Your "My Portfolio" page(s), e.g. **myportfolio.v01.html**  
5. Your Contact page, e.g. **contact.html**  
6. _Optionally:_ include any image or video files that will be linked inside your HTML _(Not necessary if you're linking content from other sites, such as an image hosted elsewhere or a video on YouTube, for example. In this case, you'll use <a href="...">...</a> tags in your HTML source)._    
7. _Optionally:_ include any necessary external JavaScript, e.g. **navbar.v01.js**  

Make sure all files are all included in your **/lab-15-personal-site** repo, and don't forget to **add**, **commit**, and **push** your changes! _(Remember: for pushing to GitHub Pages, you'll invoke `git push origin gh-pages`!)_  

In addition, prepare to **present + discuss your website and personal work for approximately 5-10 minutes** on the last day of class. Additionally, as you watch each other's presentation, think of questions or constructive comments to share; plan to answer a few questions from the class. If you're shy, **be prepared to ask a question of the presenter when I call on you.**
