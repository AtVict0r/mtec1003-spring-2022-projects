# How to Submit Your Second Round of Labs (Week 2)

So, you've learned how to "fork" a file on _GitHub_ to create your own copy of it, make some changes, and save (i.e. "commit") those changes.

This time, we'll be doing now something slightly more involved: we'll be copying some files down from _GitHub_, working on them on our local machine, and then storing all of our work this week on _GitHub_ using something they call "repositories". We'll talk about what that means later, but for now, follow this step-by-step guide below for uploading your Week 2 labs...

* From our [Schedule Page](/Goldford-MTEC1003-OL78/schedule.html), navigate to Week 2, and look under Lab Assignments. There are 3 labs.  
* Click on each of them, then right-click and "Save As..." each text file somewhere on your computer.  
* Follow the instructions in each lab. As instructed, put each of these lab files inside the same folder.  
* When your lab work is complete, you'll have all of your files collected in a single folder called "mtec1003".  
* To upload everything, first log in to _GitHub_ with your username and password.  
* In the upper-right corner, click on your avatar and select "Your Repositories":

* On the next page you'll find a list of "repositories". Find the green "New" button, and click on it:

* On the following page, enter a name for your repository, naming it "mtec1003-lab-02" as shown below. Make sure "public" is selected, and then click the checkbox next to "Initialize this repository with a README". Finally, click the green button called "Create repository" at the bottom.

* Next, find the "Add Files" button, click on it, and select "Upload Files":

* You'll then see an area of the screen where you can drag-and-drop files from your computer. Select all the files and folders you worked on this week, including those downloaded, then drag-and-drop them onto the screen. _(Remember: all files you'll need are contained in the /mtec1003-lab-02 folder on your computer. Simply "select all" of these files, or select them one and a time...)._ When finished, scroll down to the bottom where it reads, "Commit changes". We'll learn all about "commits" later, but for now, simply click the green "Commit changes" button:

* And that's it! On the next screen you should see all the files in a list. Everything has been uploaded properly and is visible for grading. However, if you see something different, let the instructor know for troubleshooting...
