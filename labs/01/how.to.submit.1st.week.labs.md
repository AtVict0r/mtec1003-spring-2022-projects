# How to Submit Your First Labs (Week 1)

* If you haven't done so already, create your account on [GitHub.com.](http://github.com/)  
* You can use some version of your name (e.g. full name, first initial and last name, etc.) as your username or choose a pseudonym. GitHub is public, so please choose whatever you feel comfortable with.  
* Check your email to **verify your address.**  

* Once you're logged into GitHub, navigate to [https://github.com/einbahnstrasse/mtec1003-week1-labs](https://github.com/einbahnstrasse/mtec1003-week1-labs).  
* In the upper-right corner, just under your avatar, click on “Fork.”  
* Once it's forked into your own account's repository, you have your own copy of these files.  
* Now, click on “Edit” or the PENCIL icon on the right.  
* Do one of two things:  
  1. Type each command out on your Terminal prompt, and copy the results into this text file on GitHub.  
  2. or if you already completed it in class, paste in the all of the results from the file on your computer into the version you see here on GitHub.  
* Scroll down to the bottom of the page and press “Commit Changes.”  
* Navigate back to the list of files.  
* Repeat these steps for "lab.01.part2.download.compress.txt." You will not need to "Fork" the repository again; just click on the file from your repository's home page, click the "Edit" button once again, and take it from there... Make your changes, then "commit" your changes using the steps agove, and you're done!  
* Check your work by going back to the list of files and ensuring that your changes were saved for both documents. Click on each file to view, and be sure your new text is visible!
