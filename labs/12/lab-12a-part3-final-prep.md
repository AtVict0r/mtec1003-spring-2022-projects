## 1. Overview of the MTEC1003 Final Assignment  

Our last class is on Monday, December 14 (i.e. Week 15), as marked on our [Schedule page.](https://einbahnstrasse.github.io/Goldford-MTEC1003-OL04/){:target="_blank"}  

On that day, your final project for the semester will be due. This will be a simple, personal website design that you write in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**_You will present your website to the class on December 14, so it must be complete and presentable by this date!_**

Everything you need to build your website will be demonstrated + practiced during these last few weeks of class; during our unit on HTML/CSS. However, you may also choose to add external elements to your website if you would like to do so — these can include custom navbars, JavaScript libraries, and other elements that you can easily test & debug in your web browser.

Get creative! Try new things. That's encouraged...

## 2. Requirements of Your Website  

Your website will have the following elements:
* a **Home** page  
  - including some simple, animated JavaScript artwork _(we'll learn this in Week 13)_  
* an **About Me** page  
  - including a photo of you _(or if you prefer not to use your own image, no worries — a placeholder image will do!)_  
* **at least 1 Portfolio page**, demonstrating some of your work or professional goals  
  - can include photos, videos, text explanations, excerpts of your code, etc.
* a **Contact Me** page  
* at least one **CSS stylesheet** linked in the header of your site's pages; i.e. for stylizing your site's appearance  
  - _You may opt to have more than one stylesheet if your design requires it._  

Your website may optionally include some **external HTML or JS elements**, if you feel comfortable using them.  
For example, our Course Website utilizes the following JavaScript libraries:
* [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/){:target="_blank"} for animated slide presentations  
* [Highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/){:target="_blank"} for code highlighting in web pages  

Feel free to experiment these or any others, if it would help you get inspired, and to help make your website more expressive!  

<p>However, do note that <span style="color: red"><i><strong>THE USE OF ANY EXTERNAL WEBSITE BUILDER, SUCH AS SQUARESPACE, CARGO, WIX, WORDPRESS, ETC., IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED!</strong></i></span> The point of this assignment is to code a simple website and design it from scratch. You will be graded on the source code you submit (not only on the elegance of your site's appearance) and your ability to follow instructions for hosting your site through GitHub pages _(we'll learn this in Week 14)_.</p>

## 3. Brainstorming Content for your Website  

For each of the pages **Home**, **About Me**, and at least 1 **Portfolio page**, start **brainstorming** ideas for **content** that will appear on your site.

Think of what you want the viewer to see when they first see your **Home** page, how you want to present yourself in your **About Me**, and what among your own projects, or professional interests, you'd want to present on any of your **Portfolio page**. Write out some initial ideas...  

In your Terminal, navigate to your **/lab-12-html** repository, and create a new folder inside of it. _(Remember: What command will you use to create a new folder?)_ Call this folder **/final-project-brainstorming**. Change your directory so that your Terminal is inside this folder. Verify you're in the correct location by running **pwd**. Your path should look something like this:

`/Users/[yourUserName]/myClasses-Fall2020/mtec1003//lab-12-html/final-project-brainstorming`

In your text editor (e.g. SublimeText, Atom, VS Code, etc.), create 3 new text documents (.txt) and save them in your **/final-project-brainstorming** folder, which is within your **/lab-12-html** repository, using the following names:
* **brainstorming-01-home-page.txt**  
* **brainstorming-02-about-me.txt**  
* **brainstorming-03-portfolio-v01.txt**  

In each of these files, type out your ideas for the content on each of the pages of your site. For example, in **brainstorming-02-about-me.txt**, type out a 1-2 paragraph **biography** with information about your education, work experience, your professional expertise or goals. Think about how you want to present yourself to a future employer, a future scholarship committee, an art gallery, on a graduate school application, etc. _Put your best foot forward!_  

Do the same for the **brainstorming-01-home-page.txt** and **brainstorming-03-portfolio-v01.txt**. What is the first thing you want them to see when they load your site in the browser? What pieces of your work would you want to present?

Each of these text files should contain _at least 1-2 paragraphs of text explaining your initial ideas_ and/or draft of body text to be published on your website.

Keep in mind: _You can change the contents of your site later!_ You don't need to turn in 100% complete ideas yet! Right now, the idea is to brainstorm and have at least a first draft of the site — that way, when we begin coding it later, you'll already have content to drop in! You can always revise this content later, add, or change things as we move forward...

* * *   

Make sure your files is included in your **/lab-12-html** folder, and don't forget to **add**, **commit**, and **push** your changes!  
Use your [_git cheatsheet_ (from lab 3)](/Goldford-MTEC1003-OL04/labs/03/lab-03-git-intro.html){:target="_blank"} if you need it!  

Your final **/lab-12-html** folder by the submission deadline should include the files from parts 1 + 2 of the Week 12 Labs, plus the new folder **/final-project-brainstorming** containing the **3 text files** described above.
